# Learning about Version Control
## Author: Thamer Aldawood

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like about version control:
1. Helps you keep track of your progress 
2. Shows you what changed in the past in case you need to revert something or learn about what was improved.

What I dislike about version control:
1. Inconsistent naming schemes (E.g., major updates being 1.1.0 > 1.1.1 and minor updates being 1.1.1 > 1.3.1).
2. The hassle of keeping your remote and local files in sync.
